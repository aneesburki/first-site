# THINGS TO CONSIDER
  - My pausings in my web dev journey were due to three reasons: a). Self-learning is a difficult approach. b). Exams can become an obstacle on the way. c). Having a different field (like being a medical student like myself). So, it's better not to pursue this path if your field is not tech-related.
  - But if you insist, then I would say bootcamp would be better rather than self-learning. Because bootcamps or academies can have assignments, tests, and there's a drive to take classes, which makes it easier to reach your goals of becoming a web developer. 

# About: 
All the crucial HTML tags and information about the HTML Language are present in the source code and on the website (which I learned in March 2024).

# Objectives: 
So, I and possibly others can make use of it. Perhaps for a quick recall, or for the beginners. 

#Coming Updates:
1. I will add more HTML tags, especially HTML Form elements.
2. I might add some CSS to it. 
3. Notes about CSS will be added here (i.e., Readme), but only if I add CSS to the website.
