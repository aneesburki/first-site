# My History with Web Development: (Skip if you want)
  - In 2023, I learned the HTML language from a YouTube course and practiced along the way (by making basic websites). 
  - And then I stopped after completing the HTML course on YouTube. 
  - However, in February-March 2024, I came across a paid web development course.
  - It gave me incredible insights about websites and the internet, and I learned HTML Tags and concepts, which I didn't know before.
  - So, this HTML-Based website is the product of that course.
  - My pausings in my web dev journey were because of two reasons: a). Self-learning is a difficult approach. b). Exams can become an obstacle on the way. c). Having a different field (like being a medical student like myself). 
  - I paused my learning again (I just learned some basic CSS from that paid course).
  - But just a couple of months later, I joined an academy (and I'm glad they had almost completed html when I joined, or else, I would had to revisit html again).
  - The academy gave me some wonderful insights that I didn't gain from the paid course. (However, I encourage combining academy learning with online content, coz that massively enhances your learning experience).
  - And lastly, joining an academy has made me a continuous learner, unlike before.
  - Sharing my story, so you don't have to acknowledge this the hard way. 

# About: 
All the crucial HTML tags and information about the HTML Language are present in the source code and on the website (which I learned in March 2024).

# Objectives: 
So, I and possibly others can make use of it. Perhaps for a quick recall, or for the beginners. 

#Coming Updates:
1. I will add more HTML tags, especially HTML Form elements.
2. I might add some CSS to it. 
3. Notes about CSS will be added here (i.e., Readme), but only if I add CSS to the website.
