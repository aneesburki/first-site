    <h1>How does the Internet work?</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Internet</em> works no different than two devices connected to each other
      through a wire, and the user tries to transfer files from one device to
      another. Internet is just the connection of billions of computers through
      wires around the world to share information to each other in the form of
      websites, images, videos, and so on, through primarily a device
      identification process (known as IP Address) and a set of rules (such as
      the Word Wide Web).

      <strong>Summary:</strong> <em>Internet</em> was initially a military
      project (in california), then it became extremely popular throughout
      United States of America, and then it started to get used in other parts
      of the world, from rich countries to poor countries. It's a worth reading
      article.

      <strong>About:</strong> In short, when we enter <em>URL</em> of a website
      into a browser, first it sends the signal to our router, then
      <em>ISP</em>, then the main internet stops, then finally the website's
      server. All these stops have their unique IP addresses. And you can see
      the speed of the IPs in ms, and it can be useful to figure out, if your
      router is okay or not. It's figured out by looking at the latency time of
      your router's IP address. <br />
      <em>How to check the "trace-route" of a website?</em> <br />
      Go to the "Command Prompt", and write "tracert -4 google.com", and you
      will get the trace-route of the website.

      <strong>About:</strong> In short, IPv6 is the latest version of "Internet
      Protocol", and is much more complex than IPv4 (by having unique IP address
      names i.e. both letters and numbers), though we still largely use IPv4.

    <h1>Programming Foundamentals Simplified</h1>
    <p>
      <strong> What exactly is programming? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming is about completing a task by a computer by giving it
      extremely precise instructions. Computers are incredibly dumb, so if the
      instructions are not 100% precise, then the computer won’t be able to
      understand your code, and your task will never be completed. A practical
      example of this can be an unintelligent friend. If you give unclear
      instructions to your unintelligent friend to complete a task, then he
      won't be able to complete the task.
    </p>
    <strong> Why do programming languages exist? </strong>
    <p>
      We also need to translate our instructions into the language of the
      computer, and the language of any computer is binary language. Otherwise,
      it wouldn’t understand its task, and the task would never be completed.
      Think of giving your friend instructions to complete a task in English,
      but he only speaks Chinese. He wouldn’t be able to understand what we were
      saying, so the task would never get completed unless the instructions were
      translated into his language. It’s possible to learn the language of a
      Chinese friend and then give him instructions in his language, but on the
      other hand, it’s impossible to learn the binary language of the computer
      and then give it instructions about a particular task. That’s why; we have
      programming languages that help as your translator friend between
      programmers and computers.
    </p>
    <strong> What types of programming languages are there? </strong>
    <p>
      Programming languages are categorized on the basis of the functions and
      secondly, the levels of a language. <br />
      On the basis of functions, some languages, such as Python and Java, are
      used for general purposes. On the other hand, Languages such as HTML and
      CSS are used for specific tasks, such as Web Development. <br />
      On the basis of levels, there are two levels of programming language,
      i.e., Low and high languages. Assembly, C, and so on are examples of
      low-level languages, and on the other hand, Java, Python, and so on are
      high-level languages. <br />
      <em
        >The code of Low-Level Languages is closer in appearance to machine
        code, hence why low-level languages are more difficult than high-level
        languages.</em
